## About

Hi! You can call me Liang for short. Now I am a junior student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, majoring in naval architecture and engineering. However, I am a sincere applicant for robotics Ms Programs, longing for a further study in Phd. Sense of practice, interests in interaction between robotics and human and occassional loneliness continuously enlighten my desire for robotics.

I am a regular gym visitor and a not bad guitar player~
